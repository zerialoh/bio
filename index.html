    <h2><u>Art</u></h2>
    <p>I have been interested in art for a very long time. A few years ago I recieved a drawing tablet which has helped my art become better.<br>I am still improving with my art, but I like to think I'm decent at it. I often share my art online and engage in artist spaces.<br>I started sharing my work online when I was 8 or 9. However, I started making art when I was younger, probably at 6 or 7.</p>

    <h2><u>Programming</u></h2>
    <p>I enjoy making websites. I've only recently started making them and have been teaching myself using resources I've found online.<br>I haven't published any of the websites that I'm working on as of now (not including this one).<br>In my free time I enjoy learning more about HTML, CSS, and Javascript, as well as how to make websites look better.</p>

    <h2><u>Music</u></h2>
    <p>Music is a very important aspect of my life. I spend a lot of my time listening to and learning about music.<br>Currently, I am learning how to play bass guitar. I have learned how to play the piano and drums in the past, but I'm not as good now.<br>I've made a lot of the friends I have now by connecting about music and bands that we both enjoy.</p>
